# machineLearningRoboticGripper

This project uses gestures to control a robotic gripper.
The gestures are captured by a webcam. They are classifyed into basic commands and then transmitted via USB to a Arduino board, that translates them into action.
The gestures are trainned by a deep learning neural network.
The resulting model is used to predict the meaning of a gesture.
